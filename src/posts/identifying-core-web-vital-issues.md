## What Are Core Web Vitals?

Core web vitals are metrics that measure the speed and responsiveness of a website. These metrics include three main elements: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). Each one of these measures a different element of your website’s performance, such as load time or page responsiveness.

## Measuring Your Core Web Vitals

Google provides tools for measuring your core web vitals. The best way to do this is through Google Search Console, which gives you an in-depth analysis of each metric and highlights any issues that need to be addressed. You can also use other tools like PageSpeed Insights or Chrome User Experience Report to get more detailed data on how quickly specific pages are loading and responding on your site.

## Identifying Issues with Your Core Web Vitals

Once you have collected data on your core web vitals, it’s time to identify any issues that may be affecting their performance. Common problems include slow loading times due to large images or files, inefficient coding leading to long response times, or poor design choices resulting in layout shifts while users interact with the page. Once you have identified the issue, you can start making changes to improve the performance of your site.
