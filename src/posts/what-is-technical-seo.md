## How Technical SEO can help you get more traffic

Technical SEO services can help you improve your website ranking. But what exactly is technical SEO? Put simply, it’s the practice of optimizing your website’s structure and content in order to maximize its visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). There are many things that could be holding you back. Let's walk through a few techniques we can use to sound them out:

## Technical SEO Audit

One of the most important elements of any successful technical SEO strategy is a comprehensive audit of your website. A technical SEO audit will analyze various aspects of your website, including page speed, indexability, crawlability, and structure. It will also examine how well your webpages are optimized for keywords and phrases that are relevant to your industry. This information can help you identify areas where improvements are necessary so that you can make changes to better optimize your site for search engine results.

## Search Console Setup & Optimization

Search consoles such as Google Search Console provide a wealth of information about how Google crawls and indexes your website. Setting up and optimizing these search consoles allows you to track any errors or issues that may be hindering your ability to rank highly in SERPs. By setting up and monitoring these platforms more closely, you can ensure that any problems are addressed quickly so that they don’t have an impact on your rankings over time.

## Page Speed Optimization

Page speed is one of the most important factors when it comes to improving website rankings. If a webpage takes too long to load, Google may not consider it as relevant or valuable as faster loading pages from other websites. To ensure that visitors don’t experience delays when visiting your site, work with an experienced team of professionals who specialize in page speed optimization techniques such as image optimization and caching strategies.
